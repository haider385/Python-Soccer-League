Dear Claire Willis,

We are happy to inform you that your child, Arnold Willis
will be playing soccer as part of the Raptors team. Arnold
will need lots of practice in order to be the best at soccer.
Because of this, the first practice day will be on the 18th 
of March at 3pm. We hope to see you soon!
