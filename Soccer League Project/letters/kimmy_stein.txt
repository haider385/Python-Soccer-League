Dear Bill and Hillary Stein,

We are happy to inform you that your child, Kimmy Stein
will be playing soccer as part of the Sharks team. Kimmy
will need lots of practice in order to be the best at soccer.
Because of this, the first practice day will be on the 17th 
of March at 3pm. We hope to see you soon!
