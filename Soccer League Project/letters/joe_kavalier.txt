Dear Sam and Elaine Kavalier,

We are happy to inform you that your child, Joe Kavalier
will be playing soccer as part of the Dragons team. Joe
will need lots of practice in order to be the best at soccer.
Because of this, the first practice day will be on the 17th 
of March at 1pm. We hope to see you soon!
