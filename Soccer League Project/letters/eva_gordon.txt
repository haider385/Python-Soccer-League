Dear Wendy and Mike Gordon,

We are happy to inform you that your child, Eva Gordon
will be playing soccer as part of the Sharks team. Eva
will need lots of practice in order to be the best at soccer.
Because of this, the first practice day will be on the 17th 
of March at 3pm. We hope to see you soon!
