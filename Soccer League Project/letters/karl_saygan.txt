Dear Heather Bledsoe,

We are happy to inform you that your child, Karl Saygan
will be playing soccer as part of the Dragons team. Karl
will need lots of practice in order to be the best at soccer.
Because of this, the first practice day will be on the 17th 
of March at 1pm. We hope to see you soon!
